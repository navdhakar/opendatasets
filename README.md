The DigiFace-1M dataset is a collection of over one million diverse synthetic face images for face recognition.
The dataset contains:

720K images with 10K identities (72 images per identity). For each identity, 4 different sets of accessories are sampled and 18 images are rendered for each set.
500K images with 100K identities (5 images per identity). For each identity, only one set of accessories is sampled.
The DigiFace-1M dataset can be used for non-commercial research, and is licensed under the license found in LICENSE.

WIDER FACE dataset is a face detection benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset. We choose 32,203 images and label 393,703 faces with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images. WIDER FACE dataset is organized based on 61 event classes. For each event class, we randomly select 40%/10%/50% data as training, validation and testing sets. We adopt the same evaluation metric employed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. Similar to MALF and Caltech datasets, we do not release bounding box ground truth for the test images. Users are required to submit final prediction files, which we shall proceed to evaluate.

## IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Classification

![Sentiment](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmzhcquzz/image/upload/v1670510524/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-IqmeHa1xHPIxL_plbaby.jpg "sentiment analysis")

This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided.
